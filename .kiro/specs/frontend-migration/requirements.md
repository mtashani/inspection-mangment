# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project involves creating a completely new and independent frontend application that will be built page by page with a systematic approach. The new frontend will be built with the latest stable technologies (Next.js, shadcn/ui) and professional, minimal, and consistent UX/UI design. Each page will be developed independently with its own domain logic, allowing for focused and principled development. We will use MCP Context7 for shadcn/ui best practices to ensure professional implementation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a new clean frontend structure, so that I can build pages systematically with independent domain logic.

2. WHEN setting up the new frontend THEN the system SHALL use latest stable Next.js with App Router
3. WHEN developing pages THEN each page SHALL have its own domain logic and be independently functional
4. WHEN structuring code THEN the system SHALL follow principled architecture patterns

### Requirement 2

3. WHEN setting up theming THEN the system SHALL use next-themes for consistent light/dark mode
4. WHEN designing components THEN the system SHALL use MCP Context7 for shadcn/ui best practices
5. WHEN configuring development THEN the system SHALL include proper ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript strict configs
6. WHEN building UI THEN the system SHALL follow professional, minimal, and consistent design patterns

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to develop login and dashboard pages with complete authentication system, so that I can establish secure access control.

2. WHEN accessing application THEN the system SHALL enforce authentication for all pages
3. WHEN using dashboard THEN the system SHALL provide card-based design with professional layout
4. WHEN needing password reset THEN the system SHALL direct user to contact admin (no internet required)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper navigation and layout system, so that I can create consistent user interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing navigation THEN the system SHALL use shadcn sidebar-07 component
