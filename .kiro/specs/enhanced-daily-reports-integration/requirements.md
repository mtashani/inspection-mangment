# Requirements Document: Enhanced Daily Reports Integration

## Introduction

Based on the analysis of the current Enhanced Daily Reports system, we have identified that while the frontend components are implemented and functional, they are currently using mock data and lack proper backend integration. This specification addresses the gap between the implemented UI components and the actual data layer, ensuring a fully functional Enhanced Daily Reports system.

The system currently has:
- ✅ Complete frontend components (EnhancedDailyReportsPage, MaintenanceEventGroup, FilterAndSearchPanel, etc.)
- ✅ UI/UX implementation with proper styling and interactions
- ❌ Backend API integration (currently using mock data)
- ❌ Real-time data fetching and updates
- ❌ Proper error handling for API failures
- ❌ Data persistence and state management
