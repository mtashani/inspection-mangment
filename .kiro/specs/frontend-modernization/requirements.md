# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for modernizing the frontend application to integrate with the new Professional Report System and RBI Calculation System. The current frontend has basic daily reports functionality and limited equipment/RBI management. We need to expand it to support the full professional reporting workflow, comprehensive equipment management, advanced RBI calculations, maintenance event tracking, and admin-only template/configuration management.

**Important Notes:**
- All pages and interfaces must be in English language
- All dates must be stored and displayed in Gregorian calendar format
- The system should maintain the existing hierarchical UX pattern for daily reports but extend it to include maintenance events and sub-events
