# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a complete frontend redesign of the Inspection Management System. The project involves creating a new Next.js 15 application with DaisyUI as the primary component library and shadcn/ui for specific components, ensuring seamless theme integration and a cohesive design system. The redesign aims to provide a modern, responsive, and theme-aware user interface with proper Persian/Jalali calendar support.

2. WHEN viewing the navigation bar THEN the system SHALL display user profile access on the left side
3. WHEN using the navigation bar THEN the system SHALL provide a theme switcher component
4. WHEN using the navigation bar THEN the system SHALL include a notifications indicator
5. WHEN using the navigation bar THEN the system SHALL provide access to AI chat functionality
6. WHEN switching themes THEN the system SHALL update the entire interface immediately

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a comprehensive dashboard page for testing themes and components, so that I can validate the design system and theme integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria
