# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the enhancement of our existing design system to achieve better design consistency, improved developer experience, and comprehensive documentation. The goal is to create a unified design language that ensures visual consistency across all components and themes while providing robust tooling for development and design teams.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Design System Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive design system documentation so that I can understand and correctly implement design patterns across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the design system documentation THEN I SHALL see complete CSS Variables reference with descriptions and usage examples
2. WHEN I review theme implementation THEN I SHALL find clear instructions on how to add new themes and modify existing ones
3. WHEN I need component guidelines THEN I SHALL have access to usage patterns, do's and don'ts, and implementation examples
4. WHEN I work with spacing and typography THEN I SHALL see the complete scale with pixel values and semantic meanings

### Requirement 2: Unified Theme System

**User Story:** As a designer, I want a consistent theme system so that all visual elements follow the same design principles across different themes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I switch between themes THEN all components SHALL maintain visual hierarchy and proportional relationships
2. WHEN I create a new theme THEN I SHALL follow a standardized structure with required CSS variables
3. WHEN I apply themes THEN semantic colors (success, warning, error) SHALL remain accessible and consistent
4. WHEN themes are applied THEN typography, spacing, and border radius SHALL scale appropriately

### Requirement 3: Interactive Component Documentation (Storybook)

**User Story:** As a developer and designer, I want interactive component documentation so that I can see all component states and variations in isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access Storybook THEN I SHALL see all design system components with their variants and states
2. WHEN I interact with components THEN I SHALL be able to test different props, themes, and responsive behaviors
3. WHEN I review component documentation THEN I SHALL see code examples, prop tables, and usage guidelines
4. WHEN I switch themes in Storybook THEN all components SHALL update to reflect the new theme immediately

### Requirement 4: Design Tokens Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want centralized design tokens so that I can maintain consistency and easily update design values across the entire system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use design tokens THEN they SHALL be available as CSS variables, TypeScript constants, and Storybook controls
2. WHEN I update a design token THEN the change SHALL propagate to all components using that token
3. WHEN I create new components THEN I SHALL use existing design tokens instead of hardcoded values
4. WHEN I work with themes THEN design tokens SHALL provide the foundation for all theme variations

### Requirement 5: Component Library Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized component APIs so that all components follow consistent patterns and are easy to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I use any component THEN it SHALL follow consistent prop naming conventions (size, variant, disabled, className)
2. WHEN I implement components THEN they SHALL use design tokens for all visual properties
3. WHEN I create component variants THEN they SHALL be clearly defined and documented
4. WHEN I handle component states THEN they SHALL follow consistent patterns for hover, focus, active, and disabled states

### Requirement 6: Development Workflow Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want integrated development tools so that design system compliance is enforced automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I write component code THEN linting rules SHALL enforce design system usage
2. WHEN I commit changes THEN pre-commit hooks SHALL validate design system compliance
3. WHEN I build the application THEN unused design system code SHALL be tree-shaken
4. WHEN I run tests THEN visual regression tests SHALL catch design inconsistencies
