# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the admin panel functionality from frontend v1 to frontend-v2 with a focus on unified design using shadcn/ui components. The admin panel serves as the central management hub for administrators to manage inspectors, attendance tracking, payroll systems, template management, and bulk operations.

The migration aims to provide a modern, consistent, and user-friendly administrative interface that maintains all existing functionality while improving the overall user experience through the shadcn/ui design system.
