# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for standardizing the RBAC system and completing the admin panel integration in the inspection management platform. The focus is on implementing the 23 standardized permissions, integrating the admin layout with the main application layout, and completing the admin domain functionality including inspector management, attendance tracking, payroll management, role/permission management, and report template management.

The current admin panel has a separate layout structure that causes confusion and inconsistency. The permission system needs to be standardized to use specific, business-focused permissions rather than generic resource:action combinations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Permission System Standardization

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to use standardized, business-specific permissions so that access control is clear and aligned with organizational roles.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining permissions THEN the system SHALL use exactly 23 predefined permissions
2. WHEN creating system permissions THEN they SHALL include system_superadmin and system_hr_manage
3. WHEN creating technical permissions THEN they SHALL follow the pattern {domain}_{action} for mechanical, corrosion, ndt, electrical, instrument, quality, and maintenance domains
4. WHEN migrating existing permissions THEN the system SHALL map current generic permissions to new standardized ones
5. IF a permission is not in the standard list THEN the system SHALL reject its creation

### Requirement 2: Admin Layout Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the admin panel to use the same layout as the main application so that the interface is consistent and familiar.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing admin pages THEN they SHALL use the main application layout structure
2. WHEN navigating between admin and regular pages THEN the layout SHALL remain consistent
3. WHEN displaying admin navigation THEN it SHALL integrate with the main sidebar/navigation system
4. WHEN showing breadcrumbs THEN they SHALL follow the same pattern as other pages
5. IF admin-specific UI elements are needed THEN they SHALL be implemented as components within the main layout

### Requirement 3: Inspector Management Interface

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want a comprehensive interface to manage inspectors so that I can handle all inspector-related operations efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing inspectors THEN the interface SHALL provide CRUD operations for inspector profiles
2. WHEN viewing inspector lists THEN the system SHALL show pagination, search, and filtering options
3. WHEN editing inspector details THEN the form SHALL include all relevant fields (personal, educational, experience, authentication)
4. WHEN assigning roles to inspectors THEN the interface SHALL provide intuitive role selection and assignment tools
5. IF an inspector has active assignments THEN the system SHALL show warnings before deletion

### Requirement 4: Attendance Management Interface

**User Story:** As an HR administrator, I want to manage inspector attendance so that I can track work hours and generate attendance reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing attendance THEN the interface SHALL show daily, weekly, and monthly views
2. WHEN recording attendance THEN the system SHALL support manual entry and bulk operations
3. WHEN generating attendance reports THEN the interface SHALL provide filtering by date range and inspector
4. WHEN managing attendance policies THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of work schedules and overtime rules
5. IF attendance data is missing THEN the system SHALL highlight gaps and allow corrections

### Requirement 5: Payroll Management Interface

**User Story:** As an HR administrator, I want to manage inspector payroll so that I can calculate salaries and generate payroll reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calculating payroll THEN the system SHALL use base rates, overtime multipliers, and attendance data
2. WHEN generating payslips THEN the interface SHALL show detailed breakdowns of earnings and deductions
3. WHEN managing payroll settings THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of rates and multipliers per inspector
4. WHEN exporting payroll data THEN the system SHALL support Excel and PDF formats
5. IF payroll calculations have errors THEN the system SHALL highlight discrepancies and allow corrections

### Requirement 6: Role and Permission Management Interface

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage roles and permissions through an intuitive interface so that I can maintain access control efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing roles THEN the interface SHALL provide CRUD operations with validation
2. WHEN assigning permissions to roles THEN the system SHALL show available permissions grouped by domain
3. WHEN viewing role assignments THEN the interface SHALL show which inspectors have each role
4. WHEN modifying permissions THEN the system SHALL show impact analysis (affected users/roles)
5. IF a role has active assignments THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion and show warnings

### Requirement 7: Report Template Management Interface

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage report templates so that I can customize inspection reports according to organizational needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing templates THEN the interface SHALL provide CRUD operations for report templates
2. WHEN designing templates THEN the system SHALL offer a visual template builder
3. WHEN organizing templates THEN the interface SHALL support categorization by inspection type
4. WHEN validating templates THEN the system SHALL check for required fields and proper structure
5. IF a template is in use THEN the system SHALL show usage statistics and prevent deletion

### Requirement 8: Enhanced Permission-Based UI Control

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see appropriate error messages when I don't have permission to perform actions so that I understand what access level is required.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking restricted buttons THEN the system SHALL show informative error messages
2. WHEN accessing restricted pages THEN the system SHALL redirect to appropriate error pages with guidance
3. WHEN viewing forms THEN disabled fields SHALL show tooltips explaining required permissions
4. WHEN navigating menus THEN restricted items SHALL be hidden or clearly marked as inaccessible
5. IF permissions change during session THEN the UI SHALL update dynamically without requiring re-login

### Requirement 9: API Completion and Standardization

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want complete and consistent APIs for all admin functions so that I can build reliable admin interfaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling inspector management APIs THEN they SHALL support all CRUD operations with proper validation
2. WHEN accessing attendance APIs THEN they SHALL provide bulk operations and reporting endpoints
3. WHEN using payroll APIs THEN they SHALL support calculation, generation, and export functions
4. WHEN calling role/permission APIs THEN they SHALL include impact analysis and validation endpoints
5. IF API calls fail THEN they SHALL return consistent error formats with actionable messages

### Requirement 10: Data Migration and Compatibility

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to migrate existing data to the new standardized system so that current operations are not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating permissions THEN the system SHALL map existing permissions to standardized ones
2. WHEN updating role assignments THEN existing inspector roles SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN converting data THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities
4. WHEN completing migration THEN all existing functionality SHALL work with new permission system
5. IF migration encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs and recovery options

### Requirement 11: Performance and User Experience
