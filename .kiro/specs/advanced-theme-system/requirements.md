# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current design system uses a custom component factory system that, while functional, deviates from the standard shadcn/ui approach. The goal is to migrate to pure shadcn/ui components as the base and then enhance them with comprehensive theme control similar to DaisyUI. Users want to control not just colors, but also component properties like border radius, sizing, spacing, shadows, and typography through themes, while maintaining shadcn/ui as the standard foundation. This feature will create a DaisyUI-like theming experience where themes can completely transform the visual appearance of standard shadcn/ui components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Enhanced Theme Configuration System

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to define comprehensive theme configurations that control all visual aspects of components, so that I can create dramatically different visual experiences through theme switching.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a theme THEN I SHALL be able to define component-specific properties including:
   - Color scheme (light/dark)
   - Base colors (--color-base-100, --color-base-200, --color-base-300, --color-base-content)
   - Semantic colors (--color-primary, --color-secondary, --color-accent, --color-neutral, --color-info, --color-success, --color-warning, --color-error)
   - Content colors for each semantic color (--color-primary-content, --color-secondary-content, etc.)
   - Component-specific radius values (--radius-box for cards/modals/alerts, --radius-field for buttons/inputs/selects, --radius-selector for checkboxes/toggles/badges)
   - Component-specific sizing (--size-selector, --size-field)
   - Border styles (--border)
   - Depth/shadow effects (--depth)
   - Visual texture (--noise)

2. WHEN I define theme properties THEN the system SHALL validate that all required properties are present and values are valid CSS units

3. WHEN I switch themes THEN ALL component properties SHALL update immediately without requiring page refresh

### Requirement 2: shadcn/ui Component Migration and Theme Property Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use standard shadcn/ui components that automatically respect theme-defined properties, so that I have a familiar component API with enhanced theming capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating to shadcn/ui THEN all existing custom factory components SHALL be replaced with standard shadcn/ui components

2. WHEN a theme defines --radius-box THEN shadcn/ui Card, Dialog, Alert, and Modal components SHALL use this radius value automatically

3. WHEN a theme defines --radius-field THEN shadcn/ui Button, Input, Select, Tab, and form field components SHALL use this radius value automatically

4. WHEN a theme defines --radius-selector THEN shadcn/ui Checkbox, Toggle, Badge, and small interactive elements SHALL use this radius value automatically

5. WHEN a theme defines --size-field THEN shadcn/ui Button and Input components SHALL use this for height and padding calculations

6. WHEN a theme defines --size-selector THEN shadcn/ui Checkbox, Toggle, and small controls SHALL use this for sizing

7. WHEN a theme defines --depth THEN shadcn/ui Card shadows and elevated elements SHALL use this value for shadow intensity

8. WHEN a theme defines semantic colors THEN shadcn/ui components SHALL automatically use the appropriate color and content color pairs (e.g., --color-primary with --color-primary-content)

### Requirement 3: DaisyUI-Style Theme Variants

**User Story:** As a designer, I want to create theme variants that completely transform the visual style (like rounded vs sharp, compact vs spacious, minimal vs rich), so that I can provide diverse visual experiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a "rounded" theme variant THEN --radius-box SHALL be set to large values (1rem+), --radius-field to medium values (0.5rem+), and --radius-selector to full rounding

2. WHEN I create a "sharp" theme variant THEN all radius variables (--radius-box, --radius-field, --radius-selector) SHALL be set to 0 or minimal values

3. WHEN I create a "compact" theme variant THEN --size-field and --size-selector SHALL use smaller values for tighter layouts

4. WHEN I create a "spacious" theme variant THEN --size-field and --size-selector SHALL use larger values for more generous spacing

5. WHEN I create a "minimal" theme variant THEN --depth SHALL be reduced and --border SHALL be subtle

6. WHEN I create a "rich" theme variant THEN --depth SHALL be prominent and --noise SHALL add visual texture

### Requirement 4: CSS Variable-Based Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the theme system to use CSS variables for all properties, so that theme switching is performant and doesn't require JavaScript style manipulation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a theme is applied THEN ALL theme properties SHALL be available as CSS variables following DaisyUI naming conventions (--color-*, --radius-*, --size-*, --border, --depth, --noise)

2. WHEN shadcn/ui components render THEN they SHALL use these specific CSS variables instead of hardcoded Tailwind classes (e.g., var(--radius-field) instead of rounded-lg)

3. WHEN theme switching occurs THEN ONLY the theme-specific CSS variables SHALL be updated, maintaining performance

4. WHEN custom CSS is written THEN developers SHALL be able to reference semantic theme variables (--color-primary, --radius-box, etc.) consistently

### Requirement 5: Migration Strategy and shadcn/ui Default Behavior

**User Story:** As a developer with existing code, I want a clear migration path from the current factory system to standard shadcn/ui components with enhanced theming, so that I can gradually update my codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating components THEN there SHALL be a clear mapping from current factory components to equivalent shadcn/ui components

2. WHEN the default theme is applied THEN shadcn/ui components SHALL look and behave exactly like standard shadcn/ui without any visual differences

3. WHEN no custom theme variables are specified THEN components SHALL fall back to shadcn/ui default values for radius, sizing, colors, and spacing

4. WHEN existing color themes are used THEN they SHALL continue to work with the new shadcn/ui components

5. WHEN migrating to enhanced themes THEN developers SHALL have migration guides and automated tools where possible

6. WHEN developers inspect the default theme THEN they SHALL see that --radius-field, --radius-box, and --radius-selector map to shadcn/ui's standard radius values

### Requirement 6: Theme Builder and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tools to create and validate themes, so that I can ensure theme consistency and catch configuration errors early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a theme THEN the system SHALL provide a TypeScript interface that enforces all required properties

2. WHEN I define invalid theme values THEN the system SHALL provide clear validation errors with suggestions

3. WHEN I build a theme THEN the system SHALL validate CSS value formats and warn about potential issues

4. WHEN I preview a theme THEN I SHALL be able to see all components rendered with the theme applied

### Requirement 7: Performance and Bundle Size

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the enhanced theme system to maintain good performance, so that theme switching doesn't impact user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN themes are loaded THEN the bundle size increase SHALL be minimal (< 10KB gzipped)

2. WHEN switching themes THEN the transition SHALL complete within 200ms

3. WHEN multiple themes are available THEN only the active theme's CSS SHALL be applied to the DOM

4. WHEN components render THEN theme property lookups SHALL not cause performance bottlenecks

### Requirement 8: Component Migration from Factory System to shadcn/ui

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from the current factory-based components to standard shadcn/ui components, so that I have a more maintainable and standard codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating Button components THEN createInteractiveComponent-based buttons SHALL be replaced with standard shadcn/ui Button components

2. WHEN migrating Card components THEN createLayoutComponent-based cards SHALL be replaced with standard shadcn/ui Card components

3. WHEN migrating Input components THEN custom Input implementations SHALL be replaced with standard shadcn/ui Input components

4. WHEN migrating Alert components THEN custom Alert implementations SHALL be replaced with standard shadcn/ui Alert components

5. WHEN migrating Badge components THEN custom Badge implementations SHALL be replaced with standard shadcn/ui Badge components

6. WHEN migration is complete THEN the custom factory system (createInteractiveComponent, createLayoutComponent, etc.) SHALL be removed

7. WHEN migration is complete THEN all components SHALL use standard shadcn/ui APIs and props

### Requirement 9: Developer Experience

**User Story:** As a developer, I want excellent tooling and documentation for the theme system, so that I can efficiently create and maintain themes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I work with themes THEN I SHALL have full TypeScript support with autocomplete for all properties

2. WHEN I create themes THEN I SHALL have access to helper functions for common theme patterns

3. WHEN I debug theme issues THEN I SHALL have clear error messages and debugging tools

4. WHEN I document themes THEN I SHALL have access to auto-generated theme documentation and examples

5. WHEN I test themes THEN I SHALL have Storybook integration that shows all components across all themes
