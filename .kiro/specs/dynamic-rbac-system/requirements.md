# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a Dynamic Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system for the inspection management platform. The system will enable inspectors to authenticate as users while maintaining their inspector profiles, with flexible role and permission management that can be configured dynamically by administrators without code changes.

The current system uses enum-based inspector types and hardcoded specialties, which limits flexibility and requires code changes for new roles or permissions. The new system will provide a comprehensive RBAC framework that supports dynamic role creation, permission assignment, and granular access control across all system features.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Inspector Authentication System

**User Story:** As an inspector, I want to log into the system using my credentials so that I can access features and reports based on my assigned roles and permissions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an inspector has login credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate them using username/password
2. WHEN an inspector logs in successfully THEN the system SHALL return a JWT token containing their roles and permissions
3. WHEN an inspector's account is inactive THEN the system SHALL deny access and return appropriate error message
4. WHEN an inspector logs out THEN the system SHALL invalidate their session client-side
5. IF an inspector has multiple roles THEN the system SHALL include all associated permissions in their token

### Requirement 2: Dynamic Role Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to create and manage roles dynamically so that I can adapt access control to changing organizational needs without requiring code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin creates a new role THEN the system SHALL store it in the database with a unique name and description
2. WHEN an admin assigns permissions to a role THEN the system SHALL create the role-permission associations
3. WHEN an admin modifies role permissions THEN the system SHALL update existing associations and apply changes immediately
4. WHEN an admin deletes a role THEN the system SHALL remove all associated permissions and user assignments
5. IF a role is assigned to active users THEN the system SHALL prevent deletion and show warning message

### Requirement 3: Granular Permission System

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to define fine-grained permissions for different resources and actions so that I can control exactly what each role can do in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining permissions THEN the system SHALL support resource-action combinations (e.g., "psv:create", "report:approve")
2. WHEN creating permissions THEN the system SHALL include display labels for UI presentation
3. WHEN permissions are assigned to roles THEN the system SHALL support many-to-many relationships
4. WHEN checking user permissions THEN the system SHALL aggregate all permissions from all user roles
5. IF new permissions are added THEN the system SHALL make them available for role assignment immediately

### Requirement 4: Inspector Role Assignment

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to assign multiple roles to inspectors so that they can perform various functions based on their qualifications and responsibilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assigning roles to inspectors THEN the system SHALL support multiple role assignments per inspector
2. WHEN an inspector's roles change THEN the system SHALL update their permissions immediately
3. WHEN viewing inspector details THEN the system SHALL display all assigned roles and effective permissions
4. WHEN removing roles from inspectors THEN the system SHALL update their access rights accordingly
5. IF an inspector has overlapping permissions from multiple roles THEN the system SHALL merge them without duplication

### Requirement 5: Dynamic UI Access Control

**User Story:** As an inspector, I want to see only the features and actions I'm authorized to use so that the interface is clean and relevant to my role.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an inspector accesses the system THEN the UI SHALL show only permitted navigation items
2. WHEN displaying action buttons THEN the system SHALL render only those the user can perform
3. WHEN loading forms THEN the system SHALL populate dropdowns with only authorized options (e.g., eligible inspectors for reports)
4. WHEN accessing restricted pages THEN the system SHALL redirect unauthorized users to appropriate error pages
5. IF permissions change during a session THEN the UI SHALL update dynamically without requiring re-login

### Requirement 6: Report Access Control

**User Story:** As an inspector, I want to access only the reports and data relevant to my role so that I can focus on my responsibilities while maintaining data security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating reports THEN the system SHALL allow only inspectors with appropriate create permissions
2. WHEN approving reports THEN the system SHALL restrict approval actions to authorized roles
3. WHEN viewing report lists THEN the system SHALL filter results based on user permissions
4. WHEN deleting reports THEN the system SHALL enforce deletion rules (own reports, section reports, or all reports)
5. IF a report requires specific inspector types THEN the system SHALL show only qualified inspectors in selection lists

### Requirement 7: Administrative Interface

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a comprehensive interface to manage roles, permissions, and user assignments so that I can efficiently maintain the access control system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing roles THEN the admin interface SHALL provide CRUD operations for roles
2. WHEN managing permissions THEN the admin interface SHALL provide CRUD operations for permissions
3. WHEN assigning permissions to roles THEN the interface SHALL provide intuitive selection and assignment tools
4. WHEN assigning roles to users THEN the interface SHALL provide bulk assignment capabilities
5. IF changes are made THEN the system SHALL log all administrative actions for audit purposes

### Requirement 8: Migration from Current System

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to migrate existing inspector types and specialties to the new RBAC system so that current users maintain their access levels during the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating existing data THEN the system SHALL convert current inspector types to equivalent roles
2. WHEN migrating specialties THEN the system SHALL convert them to appropriate permissions
3. WHEN preserving user access THEN the system SHALL ensure no inspector loses existing capabilities
4. WHEN completing migration THEN the system SHALL remove deprecated enum-based access controls
5. IF migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities and detailed error reporting

### Requirement 9: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the permission checking to be fast and efficient so that the system remains responsive even with complex role hierarchies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN checking permissions THEN the system SHALL complete authorization checks within 100ms
2. WHEN loading user permissions THEN the system SHALL cache results to minimize database queries
3. WHEN permissions change THEN the system SHALL invalidate relevant caches immediately
4. WHEN scaling to many users THEN the system SHALL maintain performance with optimized database queries
5. IF permission checks fail THEN the system SHALL fail securely by denying access

### Requirement 10: Security and Audit

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want comprehensive logging and secure permission enforcement so that I can monitor access and ensure system security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access protected resources THEN the system SHALL log all authorization attempts
2. WHEN permissions are modified THEN the system SHALL create audit trails with timestamps and user information
3. WHEN authorization fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure with relevant context
4. WHEN sensitive operations occur THEN the system SHALL require additional authentication if configured
5. IF suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators and optionally lock accounts
