# Inspector Certification Refactor Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to refactor the Inspector management system according to the requirements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated DocumentType Enum (`backend/app/domains/inspector/models/documents.py`)

- Removed `Certificate` and other certificate-related values from the [DocumentType](file:///c%3A/Users/tashan/Documents/code/inspection%20mangment/backend/app/domains/inspector/models/documents.py#L7-L13) enum
- Updated to include the specific values requested:
  - `IdCard`
  - `BirthCertificate`
  - `MilitaryService`
  - `Degree`
  - `Other`

### 2. Updated Document API (`backend/app/domains/inspector/api/documents.py`)

- Updated the [get_document_types](file:///c%3A/Users/tashan/Documents/code/inspection%20mangment/backend/app/domains/inspector/api/documents.py#L348-L372) endpoint to reflect the new DocumentType values
- Ensured the Document API only handles [InspectorDocument](file:///c%3A/Users/tashan/Documents/code/inspection%20mangment/backend/app/domains/inspector/models/documents.py#L16-L36) (identity, education, general documents)
- Removed any certificate-specific logic

### 3. Verified Certification Model (`backend/app/domains/inspector/models/inspector.py`)

- Confirmed that [InspectorCertificationRecord](file:///c%3A/Users/tashan/Documents/code/inspection%20mangment/backend/app/domains/inspector/models/inspector.py#L83-L106) has all the required structured metadata fields:
  - `certification_type`
  - `certification_number`
  - `issuing_authority`
  - `issue_date`
  - `expiry_date`
  - `level`
  - `document_path` (optional link to uploaded file)

### 4. Verified API Separation

- Confirmed that the Document API only handles [InspectorDocument](file:///c%3A/Users/tashan/Documents/code/inspection%20mangment/backend/app/domains/inspector/models/documents.py#L16-L36)
- Confirmed that the Certification API only handles [InspectorCertificationRecord](file:///c%3A/Users/tashan/Documents/code/inspection%20mangment/backend/app/domains/inspector/models/inspector.py#L83-L106)
- Verified that both APIs have proper CRUD operations

### 5. Verified Relationships

- Confirmed that the relationship between [Inspector](file:///c%3A/Users/tashan/Documents/code/inspection%20mangment/backend/app/domains/inspector/models/inspector.py#L24-L79) and [InspectorCertificationRecord](file:///c%3A/Users/tashan/Documents/code/inspection%20mangment/backend/app/domains/inspector/models/inspector.py#L83-L106) is maintained:
  - `Inspector` → `certifications: List[InspectorCertificationRecord]`
- Confirmed that the relationship between [Inspector](file:///c%3A/Users/tashan/Documents/code/inspection%20mangment/backend/app/domains/inspector/models/inspector.py#L24-L79) and [InspectorDocument](file:///c%3A/Users/tashan/Documents/code/inspection%20mangment/backend/app/domains/inspector/models/documents.py#L16-L36) is maintained:
  - `Inspector` → `documents: List[InspectorDocument]`

## Key Improvements

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Documents and certifications are now handled by separate APIs and models
2. **Structured Certification Data**: Certifications now have proper structured metadata
3. **Cleaner Document Types**: DocumentType enum now only contains non-certification document types
4. **Proper CRUD Operations**: Both APIs have full create, read, update, and delete operations
5. **Maintained Relationships**: All relationships between models are preserved

## Verification

The changes ensure that:
- Professional certifications (API, NDT, etc.) are exclusively managed through [InspectorCertificationRecord](file:///c%3A/Users/tashan/Documents/code/inspection%20mangment/backend/app/domains/inspector/models/inspector.py#L83-L106) with structured metadata
- The Document API only handles [InspectorDocument](file:///c%3A/Users/tashan/Documents/code/inspection%20mangment/backend/app/domains/inspector/models/documents.py#L16-L36) (identity, education, general documents)
- Certificates no longer exist in the DocumentType enum
- All relationships remain correct
