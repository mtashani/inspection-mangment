# PSV Management System Implementation - Complete

## Completed Implementations

### 1. Frontend Components

1. **Service Risk Form Component**
   - Created `frontend/src/components/psv/service-risk-form.tsx`
   - Implemented form for creating and editing service risk categories
   - Added proper validation and feedback

2. **Toast Notifications**
   - Added Sonner toast library integration
   - Created `frontend/src/components/ui/toast.tsx` component
   - Created `frontend/src/components/ui/use-toast.ts` hook for easy toast notifications
   - Added Toaster provider to the application layout

3. **Navigation Consistency**
   - Updated navigation links in the PSV Layout to point to the correct paths
   - Created redirect pages from standalone routes to the new layout structure

### 2. API Services

- Verified that the RBI API service is properly implemented
- Confirmed that all necessary API endpoints are available for:
  - RBI Configurations (GET, POST, PUT)
  - Service Risk Categories (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - RBI Calculations

### 3. Project Structure

- Ensured proper frontend organization with dedicated layout structure
- Added redirects from old standalone pages to the new layout structure:
  - `/psv` → `/psv-layout/psv`
  - `/psv-settings` → `/psv-layout/psv-settings`
  - `/psv-analytics` → `/psv-layout/psv-analytics`

## Benefits
