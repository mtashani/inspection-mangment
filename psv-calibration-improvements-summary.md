# PSV Calibration Dialog Enhancements

## Improvements Made

1. **Better User Interface**
   - Replaced the standard dialog with a sliding drawer/sheet UI
   - More screen real estate for better form organization
   - Modern, animated transitions for improved user experience

2. **Streamlined Form**
   - Simplified the calibration form to focus on essential fields
   - Organized fields into logical card-based sections:
     - Basic Information
     - Test Results
     - Personnel
   - Removed unnecessary RBI-related fields that are common across all PSVs

3. **Automatic RBI Level Detection**
   - Leveraged existing RBI calculation system to automatically determine the appropriate RBI level
   - No manual selection required by users
   - Shows which RBI level is being used for transparency

4. **Better Code Organization**
   - Created separate components for the drawer and form
   - Better type safety with improved TypeScript definitions
   - Fixed existing type errors in the PSV detail page

5. **Mobile-Friendly Design**
   - Responsive layout with grid columns that adapt to screen size
   - Sheet component works well on both desktop and mobile devices
   - Better spacing and organization for small screens

## Implementation

The implementation involved:

1. Creating a new API function `getAppropriateRBILevel` that leverages the existing RBI calculation system

2. Creating a new `PSVCalibrationDrawer` component that uses the Sheet UI component for a sliding panel experience

3. Developing a compact version of the calibration form (`PSVCalibrationFormCompact`) that:
   - Only includes essential fields
   - Organizes fields in a more logical way
   - Uses card sections for better visual separation

4. Updating the PSV detail page to use the new drawer component

## Technical Details

- The drawer automatically fetches the appropriate RBI level when opened
- Shows a loading indicator while determining the RBI level
- Displays a badge showing which RBI level is being used
- All form fields are properly validated

## Next Steps

Potential future improvements could include:

1. Implementing tab-based navigation within the drawer for more complex forms
2. Adding a pre-fill option based on previous calibrations
3. Supporting file uploads for calibration certificates
4. Adding inline help text explaining the RBI requirements for each field
