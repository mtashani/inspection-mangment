# Event Card Improvements - COMPLETED

## Issues Addressed ✅

### 1. **Fixed Inspection Count Display**
- **Backend Fix**: Updated [maintenance_routes.py](file://c:\Users\tashan\Documents\code\inspection%20mangment\backend\app\domains\maintenance\api\maintenance_routes.py#L134-L159) to properly calculate `inspections_count`
- **Count Calculation**: Now includes both direct event inspections and sub-event inspections
- **Database Query**: Added proper SQLModel queries to count related inspections
- **Response Enhancement**: Added `direct_inspections_count` for more granular information

### 2. **Enhanced Date Information**
- **Smart Date Display**: Shows actual dates when available, planned dates otherwise
- **Contextual Formatting**: 
  - `Actual: [start] - [end]` for completed events
  - `Started: [actual start] (Planned end: [planned end])` for in-progress events
  - `Planned: [start] - [end]` for planned events
- **Better Date Context**: More informative than just showing planned dates

### 3. **Added Creator and Approver Information**
- **Creator Display**: Shows who created the event (`created_by` field)
- **Approval Status**: Visual indicators for approval state
- **Approver Information**: Shows who approved and when (`approved_by`, `approval_date`)
- **Status Icons**: 
  - ✅ Green check for approved events
  - ⏰ Orange clock for pending approval
  - ❌ Gray X for not approved/cancelled

### 4. **Approval Status Indicators**
- **Visual Status**: Clear approval state with colored icons and text
- **Approval Date**: Shows when the event was approved
- **Pending State**: Indicates events waiting for approval
- **Smart Logic**: Handles cancelled events appropriately

## 🎨 **New UI Elements**

### Enhanced Card Layout:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Title                    [Status]   │
│ Event Number                        │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 📅 Smart Date Range                 │
│ 📋 Sub-events    🔍 Inspections      │

│ ✅ Approved by [Name]               │

│ Description...                      │

└─────────────────────────────────────┘
