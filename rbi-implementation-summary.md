# RBI Implementation and Filter Fixes Summary

## Overview

We've successfully implemented the RBI Calculation component for PSV details and fixed issues with the PSV list filters. The implementation includes:

1. New RBI Calculation tab (renamed from "Settings")
2. Complete RBI calculation component with months remaining display
3. Analytics visualizations for PSV performance data
4. Fixed filter display issues for train, unit, and type values

## Major Components Implemented

### 1. RBI Calculation Component

- Created `frontend/src/components/psv/rbi-calculation.tsx` with:
  - Display of active RBI configuration
  - Risk score and category visualization
  - Months and days remaining until next calibration with color-coding
  - Support for fallback to mock data when API endpoints are not available

### 2. API Integration

- Enhanced `frontend/src/api/rbi.ts` with:
  - Robust error handling for missing endpoints
  - Mock data generation for development/testing
  - Type-safe interfaces

### 3. PSV Detail Page Integration

- Updated `frontend/src/app/psv/[id]/layout.tsx` to rename "Settings" tab to "RBI Calculation"
- Created `frontend/src/app/psv/[id]/settings/page.tsx` to host the RBI calculation component
- Implemented `frontend/src/app/psv/[id]/analytics/page.tsx` with performance visualization charts

### 4. Filter Display Fixes

- Modified `frontend/src/components/data-table/data-table-faceted-filter.tsx` to:
  - Ensure labels are properly connected to checkboxes using correct IDs
  - Prevent text truncation with `whitespace-nowrap` class
  - Increase the filter dropdown width to accommodate longer values
  - Ensure full display of train, unit and type values instead of just first letter

## Key Technical Solutions

### Error Handling & Resilience

- Added comprehensive null checks throughout the RBI component
- Created fallbacks for missing API endpoints
- Added proper error messages when configurations are missing
- Implemented defensive programming for date calculations
- Handle edge cases with conditional rendering

### UI Improvements

- Added color-coded indicators for time remaining:
  - Red: Overdue
  - Orange: < 3 months
  - Yellow: < 6 months
  - Green: > 6 months
- Added "Development Preview" indicator during API development
- Fixed filter display issues to show complete values

## Status Documentation

Created `psv-rbi-status.md` documenting:
- Current implementation status
- Backend API expectations
- Known issues and workarounds
- Next steps for completion

## Testing

The implementation handles several error conditions gracefully:
- Missing RBI configuration
- Backend API errors with calculation
- Invalid date formats
- Missing properties in response objects

## Next Steps

1. Complete backend API implementation for:
   - `/api/psv/rbi/config/active`
   - `/api/psv/rbi/{tag_number}/calculate?level={level}`
   - Fix the backend error: `'Calibration' object has no attribute 'leak_test_result'`

2. Update RBI calculation component to remove mock data once API is ready
