# 🔧 Search and Date Filter Implementation Summary

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Search Filter (Title, Number, Description)**
- **Backend**: Added `search` parameter to `/api/v1/inspections` endpoint
- **Backend**: Implemented case-insensitive search across `title`, `inspection_number`, and `description` fields using SQL `ILIKE`
- **Frontend**: Updated API service to send `search` parameter
- **Frontend**: Updated types to include search in `InspectionsFilters`

### 2. **Date Filter with Field Selection**
- **Backend**: Added `date_field` parameter to choose which date field to filter on
- **Backend**: Added flexible date filtering for 4 date fields:
  - `planned_start_date` - Planned start date
  - `planned_end_date` - Planned end date  
  - `actual_start_date` - Actual start date (default)
  - `actual_end_date` - Actual end date
- **Frontend**: Added date field selector UI (dropdown with emojis)
- **Frontend**: Updated filters to include `dateField` parameter

### 3. **API Integration**
- **Frontend**: Fixed query enablement for global search (empty eventId)
- **Frontend**: Updated API service to pass all new parameters
- **Frontend**: Added debug logging for development
- **Backend**: Enhanced filtering logic with proper query building

## 🧪 Testing Status

✅ **Backend API**: Tested via curl - working correctly
- Basic query: Returns inspections with pagination
- Search functionality: Returns filtered results for "inspection"  
- No results for terms that don't match (expected behavior)

⏳ **Frontend Integration**: Ready to test
- All components updated with new functionality
- Debug logging enabled for development
- Query always enabled for better UX

## 🎯 How to Test

### Test Search Filter:
1. Go to Events page
2. Switch to "Inspections" mode
3. Try searching for:
   - "inspection" (should find results)
   - "tower" (should find results) 
   - "distillation" (should find results)
   - "valve" (may find results)
   - "xyz123" (should find no results)

### Test Date Filter:
1. In Inspections mode, select a date range
2. Change the date field dropdown to test different date fields:
   - 📅 Planned Start (planned_start_date)
   - 📅 Planned End (planned_end_date) 
   - 🏁 Actual Start (actual_start_date) - default
   - 🏁 Actual End (actual_end_date)
3. Should see results change based on date field selection

### Test Combined Filters:
1. Use search + date filter + equipment tag together
2. Should see filters combine (AND logic)
3. Active filters should show in badges
4. Clear filters should work

## 🔄 Expected Behavior

1. **Empty Results**: If no inspections match search terms, should show "No inspections found" message
2. **Search Results**: Should highlight matching inspections 
3. **Date Filtering**: Should filter based on selected date field
4. **Pagination**: Should work with all filters
5. **Active Filters**: Should display as badges with clear buttons

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If still not working:

1. **Check Backend**: Ensure backend is restarted and running on :8000
2. **Check Database**: Verify there are inspections in the database
3. **Check Network**: Open browser dev tools → Network tab to see API calls
4. **Check Console**: Look for debug logs starting with 🛠️ and 📨
5. **Check Search Terms**: Try "inspection" instead of "test"

## 📋 Database Content

Based on API test, there are inspections with titles like:
- "Unplanned Inspection - Distillation Tower"  
- Similar inspection records

So search terms like "inspection", "tower", "distillation" should work.

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. Test the frontend UI with the working backend
2. Verify search and date filtering work as expected
3. Check pagination works with filters
4. Remove debug logging once confirmed working
