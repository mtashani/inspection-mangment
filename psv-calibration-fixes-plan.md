# PSV Calibration Functionality Fixes - Implementation Status

## Fixed Issues

1. **Added PUT Method for Calibration Updates**
   - Implemented the missing PUT method in `frontend/src/app/api/calibration/route.ts`
   - This enables the `updateCalibration()` function to properly communicate with the backend
   - Added robust error handling and logging to make debugging easier

2. **Enhanced Error Handling for New Calibrations**
   - Improved the POST method with better validation and error logging
   - Added checks for required fields like `tag_number`
   - Enhanced error responses from the API for more informative feedback

3. **Confirmed Form Layout Consistency**
   - Both add and edit forms use the same `CustomCalibrationForm` component
   - The Date and Work Number fields are consistently displayed side-by-side in a flex container
   - No changes needed for this issue as it was already implemented correctly

## Findings During Implementation

- We identified a potential mismatch between the form schema and the data being submitted during calibration
- As per instructions, we did not modify the data structure being sent to the API
- The improved error logging will help identify precisely where any remaining issues are occurring

## How to Test

1. **Edit Calibration Test**
   - Open an existing PSV's details page
   - Click the edit button on a calibration record
   - Make changes to the calibration data
   - Submit the form
   - Verify the updates are saved and displayed correctly

2. **Add Calibration Test**
   - Navigate to a PSV's details page
   - Click "Add New Calibration"
   - Fill in all required fields
   - Submit the form
   - Check the browser console for any error messages if it fails
   - Verify the new calibration appears in the history list if successful

3. **Further Debugging**
   - If issues persist, check the browser developer console
   - Look for the enhanced logging messages we've added
   - These will show exactly what data is being sent and any error responses
