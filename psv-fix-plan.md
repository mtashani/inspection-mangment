# PSV Page Issues Diagnosis and Fix Plan

## Current Status

- ✅ API Endpoints are working correctly (confirmed by the debug test)
- ❌ PSV pages are not displaying data with "Failed to fetch" errors

## Diagnosis

Since your API endpoints are working correctly but the PSV pages aren't displaying data, the issue is likely one of:

1. **URL Structure Mismatch**: The `/psv-layout/psv` URLs might not match what your navigation is expecting
2. **Component Error Handling**: The PSV components might not be properly handling data or errors
3. **Redirect Issues**: The redirect from `/psv` to `/psv-layout/psv` might not be working correctly

## Fix Plan

### Step 1: Try the Simple Test Page

First, navigate to the test page I created at:
```
http://localhost:3000/psv-test
```

If data appears on this page but not on the main PSV pages, then we know the issue is with the component rendering or routing, not the API.

### Step 2: Fix the Navigation Structure

There are two options to fix the current routing issue:

**Option A: Simplify by Using Existing Pages**
1. Remove the redirects and use the original pages directly
2. Update the PSV navigation to point to the correct URLs

**Option B: Fix the Layout Structure**
1. Modify the navigation links in `psv-layout/layout.tsx` to match the actual URLs
2. Ensure all imports and components are correctly configured

### Step 3: Update the API Loading and Error Handling

Add better error handling to all PSV pages:

```javascript
try {
  const data = await fetchPSVs();
  // process data
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Detailed fetch error:", error);
  // show user-friendly error
}
```

## Implementation

Based on what you saw in the test page, here's how to fix all PSV pages:

### If the Test Page Shows Data:

1. **Update Layout Navigation Links**:
   In `frontend/src/app/psv-layout/layout.tsx`, make sure links point to:
   ```javascript
   const navigationItems = [
     {
       title: "PSV List",
       href: "/psv-layout/psv",  // Updated to match folder structure
     },
     // other items similarly
   ];
   ```

2. **Add Console Logging**:
   Add detailed console.log statements in your PSV pages to track exactly where failures occur

3. **Update Toast Notifications**:
   Add toast notifications for errors to make them more visible to users

### If the Test Page Doesn't Show Data:

This would indicate a deeper issue with how the frontend interacts with the backend. In that case, we'll need to:

1. Check the Network tab in browser DevTools to see the exact API requests and responses
2. Verify if there are any errors in the console that might provide clues
3. Ensure the data format returned by the API matches what the components expect

## Testing Your Fix

After making changes:

1. Test the simple `/psv-test` page first
2. Then try the main PSV pages at the proper URLs
3. Check browser console for any errors
