# Daily Reports Page Redesign Plan

## Current Issues
1. Layout and organization is not optimal
2. Filters overflow horizontally on smaller screens
3. Inspection addition form needs better organization
4. Components are not fully responsive

## Proposed Improvements

### 1. Filters Component (`filters.tsx`)
- Implement responsive grid layout using Tailwind's grid system
- Convert from flex-nowrap to grid with auto-fit columns
- Ensure filters wrap properly on smaller screens
- Add proper spacing between filter groups
- Maintain visual hierarchy with consistent labeling

```tsx
// Example structure
<div className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4">
  {/* Filter components */}
</div>
```

### 2. New Inspection Form (`new-inspection-form.tsx`)
- Improve form layout with proper spacing
- Make form elements full width on mobile
- Add clear section separation
- Ensure consistent heights for form controls

```tsx
// Example structure
<Card className="w-full">
  <CardContent className="p-6">
    <form className="grid gap-6 sm:grid-cols-[2fr_1fr_auto]">
      {/* Form fields */}
    </form>
  </CardContent>
</Card>
```

### 3. Edit Report Form (`edit-report-form.tsx`)
- Improve responsive layout for form fields
- Better organize date and inspector selection
- Make description field properly responsive
- Add proper spacing between sections

### 4. General Improvements
- Consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale
- Proper responsive breakpoints for all components
- Consistent form field heights and alignments
- Better mobile experience with stacked layouts
- Clear visual hierarchy

## Implementation Steps

1. Update Filters Component
   - Modify layout structure
   - Add responsive classes

## Technical Details

### Breakpoints
- sm: 640px

- lg: 1024px
- xl: 1280px

### Spacing Scale
