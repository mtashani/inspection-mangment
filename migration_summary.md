# Domain-Based Error Logging Migration Summary

## Project Overview

Successfully migrated the FastAPI project to a domain-based error logging system that automatically captures and logs API errors with domain-specific context. This system provides comprehensive error tracking with minimal code changes and automatic sanitization of sensitive data.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Logging Infrastructure

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/app/core/api_logging.py` - Added `@log_api_errors(domain_name)` decorator and helper functions
- `backend/app/core/logging_config.py` - Configured domain-specific loggers with rotating file handlers
- `backend/app/main.py` - Integrated global exception handlers for 415 errors

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Automatic error capture for all HTTP status codes (400-500)
- Domain-specific log files in `backend/logs/{domain}_api_errors.log`
- Built-in sanitization for sensitive fields (passwords, tokens, keys)
- Request context extraction (endpoint, method, user ID, request data)
- Stack trace preservation for debugging

### 2. Domain Endpoint Updates

#### Equipment Domain
**File:** `backend/app/domains/equipment/api/equipment.py`
- Applied `@log_api_errors("equipment")` to all 7 endpoints
- Removed legacy logging code
- Verified proper error capture for CRUD operations

#### Maintenance Domain  
**File:** `backend/app/domains/maintenance/api/maintenance_routes.py`
- Applied `@log_api_errors("maintenance")` to all 25+ endpoints
- Removed legacy logging code
- Verified proper error capture for complex business logic

#### Inspector Domain
**File:** `backend/app/domains/inspector/api/inspector.py`
- Applied `@log_api_errors("inspector")` to all 20+ endpoints
- Removed legacy logging code
- Verified proper error capture for authentication and authorization flows

### 3. Documentation and Testing

**Files Created:**
- `migration_guide.md` - Comprehensive step-by-step migration instructions
- `test_logging.py` - Automated test script to verify logging functionality

## Migration Checklist

### ✅ Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
- [x] Implement `@log_api_errors(domain_name)` decorator
- [x] Configure domain-specific loggers with rotation
- [x] Integrate global exception handlers for 415 errors
- [x] Verify sensitive data sanitization

### ✅ Phase 2: Domain Migration
- [x] Apply logging decorator to all equipment endpoints
- [x] Apply logging decorator to all maintenance endpoints  
- [x] Apply logging decorator to all inspector endpoints
- [x] Remove all legacy logging code
- [x] Ensure consistent domain naming

### ✅ Phase 3: Verification and Testing
- [x] Create comprehensive migration guide
- [x] Develop automated test script
- [x] Verify error logs are written to correct files
- [x] Confirm sensitive data is properly sanitized
- [x] Test all HTTP status codes (400-500) are captured

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Improved Debugging
- Automatic error capture eliminates manual logging
- Rich context (endpoint, method, user, request data) simplifies root cause analysis
- Stack traces preserved for complex error scenarios

### 2. Enhanced Security
- Built-in sanitization prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data
- No risk of logging credentials or personal information
- Compliant with data protection requirements

### 3. Better Organization
- Domain-specific log files improve navigation and searchability
- Eliminates noise from mixed-domain logs
- Enables domain-team ownership of error resolution

### 4. Reduced Maintenance
- Single decorator replaces dozens of manual logging statements
- Consistent format across all endpoints
- Automatic log rotation prevents disk space issues

## Usage Instructions

### For New Endpoints
1. Add `@log_api_errors("<domain_name>")` decorator before `@router`
2. Ensure endpoint accepts `Request` or user objects for context extraction
3. Remove any manual logging statements

### For Error Testing
1. Run `python test_logging.py` to verify logging functionality
2. Check `backend/logs/{domain}_api_errors.log` for error entries
3. Confirm sensitive data is sanitized in logs

### For Log Analysis
1. Monitor `backend/logs/{domain}_api_errors.log` for error patterns
2. Use log analysis tools to identify recurring issues
3. Set up alerts for critical error volumes

## Future Enhancements

### Recommended Improvements
1. Add structured logging support (JSON format)
2. Implement log aggregation for multi-instance deployments
3. Add performance monitoring integration
4. Create dashboard for real-time error tracking
5. Add alerting for critical error thresholds

### Maintenance Best Practices
1. Regularly review log files for completeness and anomalies
2. Monitor disk space usage for log directories
3. Periodically audit logging configuration for optimal performance
4. Train new developers on logging conventions
5. Establish log retention policies

## Conclusion

The domain-based error logging system provides a robust foundation for error tracking and debugging. By following the migration guide and using the test scripts, teams can quickly adopt this system and benefit from improved error visibility, enhanced security, and reduced maintenance overhead.

All migration tasks have been completed successfully, and the system is ready for production use.
