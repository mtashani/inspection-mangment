## RBI (Risk-Based Inspection)

### Understanding RBI

Risk-Based Inspection helps prioritize inspection activities based on:
- **Probability of Failure (PoF)**: Likelihood of equipment failure
- **Consequence of Failure (CoF)**: Impact if failure occurs
- **Risk Level**: Combined assessment (PoF √ó CoF)

### RBI Calculation Levels

**Level 1 - Qualitative**
- Basic risk assessment
- Simplified parameters
- Quick evaluation

**Level 2 - Semi-Quantitative**
- More detailed analysis
- Industry standard methods
- Moderate complexity

**Level 3 - Quantitative**
- Comprehensive analysis
- Advanced calculations
- Detailed parameters

### Performing RBI Calculations

1. **Navigate** to Equipment ‚Üí Select Equipment ‚Üí RBI Tab
2. **Choose** RBI calculation level
3. **Fill** Probability of Failure parameters:
   - General metal loss rate
   - Localized corrosion rate
   - Stress corrosion cracking susceptibility
   - Fatigue considerations
   - High temperature effects
4. **Complete** Consequence of Failure parameters:
   - Release scenarios
   - Flammable consequences
   - Toxic effects
   - Environmental impact
   - Business interruption costs
5. **Calculate** RBI score
6. **Review** results and recommendations
7. **Save** calculation for records

### RBI Results Interpretation

**Risk Levels**
- **üü¢ Low Risk**: Routine inspection intervals
- **üü° Medium Risk**: Enhanced monitoring
- **üî¥ High Risk**: Frequent inspections required
- **‚ö´ Very High Risk**: Immediate action needed

**Inspection Intervals**
