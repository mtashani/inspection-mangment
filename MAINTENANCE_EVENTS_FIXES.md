# Maintenance Events Fixes Summary

This document describes the fixes applied to resolve three key issues in the maintenance events system.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ Overdue Events Card Removed
**Problem:** The "Overdue Events" card was showing in the maintenance events page but user reported it as unnecessary.

**Solution:** 
- Removed the `overdue-events` card from the `summary-cards.tsx` component
- Updated the `events-overview-container.tsx` to remove references to overdue events filtering
- The card has been completely removed from the UI

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend-v2/src/components/maintenance-events/summary-cards.tsx`
- `frontend-v2/src/components/maintenance-events/events-overview-container.tsx`

### 2. ✅ Active Inspections Count Fixed
**Problem:** The "Active Inspections" card was showing 0 even when there were active inspections.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced the API response mapping in `maintenance-events.ts` to check multiple possible fields for active inspections
- Added fallback to `inspection_status_breakdown.InProgress` if main field is not available
- This ensures the count is displayed correctly regardless of backend response structure

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend-v2/src/lib/api/maintenance-events.ts`

**Code Change:**
```typescript
activeInspections: (response as any)?.active_inspections || 
                  (response as any)?.status_breakdown?.InProgress || 
                  (response as any)?.inspection_status_breakdown?.InProgress || 0,
```

### 3. ✅ Date Picker Timezone Issue Fixed
**Problem:** When selecting start and end dates in the event creation/editing modal, the dates were being saved one day earlier due to timezone conversion issues.

**Solution:**
- Replaced `toISOString().split('T')[0]` with a custom `formatLocalDate` function
- This function manually constructs the date string using local time components instead of UTC
- Applied the fix to all date selection components

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend-v2/src/components/maintenance-events/create-event-modal.tsx`
- `frontend-v2/src/components/maintenance-events/edit-event-modal.tsx`
- `frontend-v2/src/components/maintenance-events/create-sub-event-modal.tsx`

**Code Change:**
```typescript
const formatLocalDate = (date: Date): string => {
  const year = date.getFullYear()
  const month = String(date.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0')
  const day = String(date.getDate()).padStart(2, '0')
  return `${year}-${month}-${day}`
}
```

## Testing Instructions

### For Active Inspections:
1. Navigate to the maintenance events page
2. Check if the "Active Inspections" card shows the correct count
3. If backend provides data in different fields, the fallback mechanism should work

### For Date Selection:
1. Open the "Create New Event" modal
2. Select start and end dates using the date picker
3. Verify that the selected dates are saved correctly (same dates that were selected)
4. Test in different timezones to ensure consistency

### For Removed Overdue Card:
1. Navigate to the maintenance events page
2. Verify that the "Overdue Events" card is no longer visible
3. Only 9 cards should be displayed instead of 10

## Technical Details

- **Timezone Fix**: The issue was caused by JavaScript's `toISOString()` method converting dates to UTC, which could shift the date by one day depending on the local timezone.
- **API Enhancement**: Added multiple fallback checks to ensure data is retrieved regardless of backend response structure variations.
- **UI Cleanup**: Removed unnecessary card and associated filtering logic to clean up the interface.

## Benefits

1. **Better User Experience**: Dates are now saved exactly as selected by the user
2. **More Accurate Data**: Active inspections count displays correctly
3. **Cleaner Interface**: Unnecessary "Overdue Events" card removed as requested
4. **Robust Data Handling**: Multiple fallbacks ensure data displays even if backend structure changes

All changes maintain backward compatibility and include proper error handling.
