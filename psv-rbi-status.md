# PSV RBI Feature Implementation Status

## Current Status: Development Preview

The RBI Calculation and Analytics features have been implemented in the frontend with mock data support. These features provide a realistic preview of the functionality while the backend APIs are being developed.

## Features Implemented

### 1. RBI Calculation Tab
- Added as a dedicated tab in the PSV detail page
- Shows active RBI configuration details
- Calculates and displays risk scores and categories
- Shows months/days remaining until next calibration
- Color-coded indicators based on urgency

### 2. Analytics Tab
- Performance trend charts
- Risk assessment visualizations
- Test results distribution analysis
- Key performance metrics

## Important Notes

### Mock Data Usage
- Currently using mock data for demonstration purposes
- The actual calculations will be performed by the backend when ready
- Mock data is realistic but not based on actual PSV history

### Backend Integration Status
- RBI configuration endpoints partially working
- RBI calculation endpoint returning errors:
  - `'Calibration' object has no attribute 'leak_test_result'`
- Mock data will continue to be used until backends are fully implemented

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Fixes Needed**:
   - Fix the `leak_test_result` attribute error in the RBI calculation endpoint
   - Implement proper risk calculation logic on the backend
   - Complete the calibration data analysis endpoints

2. **Testing Process**:
   - Verify calculations against expected outcomes
   - Validate risk categories and scoring
   - Test with historical calibration data

## Using the Features

Despite the backend being incomplete, you can still:
1. View and interact with the RBI Calculation tab
2. See realistic mock data for time remaining until calibration
3. Explore the Analytics visualizations
4. Get familiar with the user interface and functionality

Once the backend work is completed, the mock data will be replaced with real calculations automatically.
